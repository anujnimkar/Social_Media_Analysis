# Social_Media_Analysis
This project was one of the class projects for the statistics course during my Master's at UMD. The project uses various statistical testing methods such as T-tests, Chi-squared tests, ANOVA, regression methods, hypothesis testing scenarios to gauge the impact of social media on social relationships. The study was guided by Dr Susan Winter, Associate Dean of Research at University of Maryland.



Attached is the final white paper for the analysis.
